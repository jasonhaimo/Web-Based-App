# Web-Based-App
This is an agenda that we will follow to kick off the project and gather our requirements for building this web based application.
We will follow this agenda and each day we will hold a daily stand up to discuss any issues or blockers which someone may have thought of or may have come up since the previous day.
1) Sit down with the team and look over the legacy system to get an understanding of what was done and what we may be able to take with us in creating this new web based application.
2) Sit down with the stakeholders each day and go over the discovery phase which they did to understand what they are looking to accomplish and to keep them aprised of what the team has been working on to start the project.  Discuss if there is are any pieces of the legacy system they would like to bring over to the new application.  Ask the stakeholders of they have any mockups or wireframes of what they are thinking it should look like.
3) Give the teams feedback on what we think could be brought over and if the stakeholders think it is something they would like to do.
4) Discuss with the team the requirements given by the stakeholders and decide what we think is feasible and if something may not fit into what can be done.
5) If stakeholders do not have any mockups or wireframes, start creating one that could and work with the team on its creation.
6) Start writing any functional documents that may be needed around the build of the application.
7) Sit down with the Tech Lead and Design Lead to discuss how we want to delegate the roles and what we feel should be worked on first.
8) Work on building a backlog of items to work on so not to fall behind and have something to work on when another job is completed.
9) Discuss with stakeholders long term plan for the application and what they are looking to build in the future.
10) Disucss with stakeholders if they want an 'out of the box' version of the application which can be sold to different clients and enhanced as needed.
